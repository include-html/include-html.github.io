<h2>Installing &lt;include-html></h2>

There is no NPM package, this element is about using less dependencies. 
<ul>
    <li>
        Copy the <a href="https://include-html.github.io/element-include-html.js"><code>element-include-html.js</code></a> file to your project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Steal the code and work it into your own BaseClass 
    </li>
    <li>
        Or include the raw JS code in a &lt;script> tag in your (main) HTML file.
    </li>
    <li>
        For testing purposes load it from this GitHub repo:
        <br><code>&lt;script src="https://include-html.github.io/element-include-html.js">&lt;/script></code>
    </li>
</ul>
